## MOTIVATION

As we know, our world is battling high food wastage, widespread hunger and extensive food insecurity. These are all problems that directly affect the basic quality of life. Moreover, higher food wastage also means that we would need to build more waste disposal facilities, which leads to an unnecessary increase energy consumption.

However, by distributing these food leftovers to people who are unable to afford food on their own, we can alleviate their standard of living. So the value of this product is the possibility of solving all the mentioned problems, without even increasing the food output.
